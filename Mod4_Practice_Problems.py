# 1. Construct a truth table for the expression: (A AND B) OR (NOT B) where A and B each can be True or False. Your truth table should be commented out (as it's not valid Python code!)

# A     | B     | A AND B | NOT B  | (A AND B) OR (NOT B)
# ---------------------------------------------------------
# True  | True  | True    | False  | True
# True  | False | False   | True   | True
# False | True  | False   | False  | False
# False | False | False   | True   | True

# 2. The headlights of a car should only automatically turn on when the daylight outside is below a certain threshold. If a sensor threshold is below the number 8, print "Headlights On"; otherwise, print "Headlights Off".

daylight = float(input("Enter the amount of daylight: "))
if daylight <= 8:
    print("Headlights On")
else:
    print("Headlights Off")

# 3. Prompt the user for their bank balance. Evaluate whether the balance is less than $100. Print True if the userâ€™s balance is below $100; print False, otherwise.

balance = float(input("Enter your bank balance: "))
true_balance = balance < 100
print(true_balance)

# 4. A theater wants to enforce age restrictions for movie tickets. Ask the user for their age, and tell them whether they can see G (appropriate for under 13), PG-13 (appropriate for 13 to 17), or R (appropriate for over 18) rated movies.

age = int(input("What is your age: "))
if age < 13:
    print('You may view "G" rated movies.')
elif age <= 17:
    print('You may view "G" and "PG-13" rated movies.')
else:
    print('You may view "G", "PG-13", and "R" rated movies.')

# 5. A store charges $5 for shipping on any order under $50. If the order amount is $50 or more, shipping is free. Ask the user for the order total and print the total cost, including shipping.

order = float(input("What is the total cost of your order: "))
if order < 50:
    print("Your order is " + str(order + 5) + " dollars.")
else:
    print("Your order is " + str(order) + " dollars.")
